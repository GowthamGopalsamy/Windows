        <div class="intro">
            Essential Calculate is a class library that lets you add formula calculation support
            to both Window Forms and Web Forms applications. Essential Calculate does not depend
            upon Microsoft Excel and thus allows you to perform calculations independent of
            Excel. The range of calculations runs from simple algebraic expressions such as (1.2^3-1)/8,
            to formulas using intrinsic functions like 4 * sqrt(exp(8.4)), to formulas relying
            on variables that are defined through controls on a form such as cos([textBox1]
            * pi()/180), to spreadsheet-like formulas such as Sum(A2:B14). Essential Calculate
            lets you parse and compute such expressions and includes a library of more than
            150 functions. This function library is easily extendable. The data used in the
            calculations can be from any source, ranging from fixed values, to values that are
            entered through controls, to data tables and Excel spreadsheets.
