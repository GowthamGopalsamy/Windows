<p><b>Essential XlsIO</b> has support for creating richly formatted spreadsheets from scratch independent of Excel. Advanced features, like
data validation, conditional formatting, and charts, are also supported. This sample demonstrates the creation of a simple,
multi-sheet workbook. Formats like Excel 97-2003, Excel 2007, Excel 2010, Excel 2013, CSV, SpreadsheetML, Excel 2007 Template, 
and Excel 2007 Macro Enabled Template are supported and demonstrated here.</p>

the <strong>IWorkbook</strong> interface. This workbook has one worksheet by default and number of worksheets can be created
based on the need. The<strong> IRange</strong> interface can be used to access the cell and write the content.</p>
