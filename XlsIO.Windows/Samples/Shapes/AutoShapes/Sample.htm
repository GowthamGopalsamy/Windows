Once you insert an AutoShape, you can also put a text inside it and you can move or resize them as you wish</p>

<p>The<strong> IShape</strong> interface is the in-memory representation of the
AutoShapes in an Excel workbook. These are used to create Autoshapes and to set properties for those shapes.
