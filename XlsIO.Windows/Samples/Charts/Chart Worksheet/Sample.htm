These are employed to give a clearer view when using a large chart
with a large amount of data. The chart is linked to the worksheet data and is updated automatically when
there are changes.</p>

<p>The <strong>IChart</strong> interface is the in-memory representation of the
chart worksheet in an Excel workbook. These are used to create charts and to set properties for those charts.
