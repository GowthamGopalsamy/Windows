<p>This sample focuses on the encryption and decryption of an Excel 2007, Excel 2010 and Excel 2013 workbook using Essential XlsIO.</p>

<p>Encryption is a method of protecting workbook data.&nbsp; It is based on a 
password that converts the data into a form that cannot be understood; it also
restricts anonymous users from accessing a document. Decryption is the process of converting encrypted data back into its original form so that data can be read from the workbook.</p>
<p class="style1">A password for encrypting a workbook can be set in Microsoft Excel 2007, Excel 2010 and Excel 2013 through 
the <strong>Office Menu</strong>-><strong>Prepare</strong>-><strong>Encrypt Document</strong> command.</p>
