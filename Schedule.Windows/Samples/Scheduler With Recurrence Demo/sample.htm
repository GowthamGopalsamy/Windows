<p> As mentioned, this sample supports recurring appointments. When you edit an existing appointment, or enter a new one, you have the option to make the appointment a recurring appointment by clicking the 
"Make Recurring" button on the <strong>Enter Appointment</strong> screen. Clicking this button will pop up an "Appointment Recurrence" dialog box, in which you can specify the recurring definition. </p>
&nbsp;
	<li>&nbsp;You can click on a single date in the navigation calendar to display the 
day view for that particular clicked date. You can also drag-select dates or control-click dates in the 
navigation calendar to display appointments for several days.</LI>
