<h1>Scripting</h1>

<p>The Scripting sample demonstrates Essential Diagram's support for adding 
scriptable interactivity to diagrams. It demonstrates how behaviours can be 
defined for diagram entities at run time using a scripting 
language of your choice, such as C#, Visual Basic.NET, or JScript.NET. </p>

<h3><strong>Features</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>An advanced script-editor control with object browsing, code generation, file I/O, and syntax highlighting capability provides a rich environment for interactively creating and working with script code.</p></li>

<li><p>The application includes sample scripts in C#, Visual Basic.NET, and JScript.NET 
that are located under the 
<strong>TESTSCRIPT </strong>folder. Running one of the provided scripts and performing actions such as clicking on a node, or 
adding or removing symbols, will execute a defined behaviour, such as changing the node color or displaying a message box. </p></li>
<li><p>The script can be stopped and the code edited at any time in order to modify diagram behaviour. </p></li>
</ul>
