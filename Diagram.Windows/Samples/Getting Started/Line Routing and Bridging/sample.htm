<h1>Line Bridging and Routing</h1>
<p>This sample demonstrates the &quot;Line Routing&quot; and &quot;Line Bridging&quot; features available in Essential Diagram.
</p>
<p>
<table width="100%">
<tr  >
<td width="100%" colspan="3">
<div align=center>
<img colspan="2" Stretch="None" src="Images\sample.png"/>
</div>

</td>
</table>
</p>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p><ul>
<li>		Line Bridging : Line bridging provides the visual effect such that the links jump over other links that are found in its way with lower ZOrder, thereby avoiding the links from intersecting each other and providing a hassle-free view to clearly state the various connections between the nodes.</li>
<li>		Line Routing : When a link is drawn between two nodes, by enabling the LineRoutingEnabled property of that link and the diagram view, and if any other node is found in between them, the line will be automatically re-routed around those nodes.</li>
</ul>
